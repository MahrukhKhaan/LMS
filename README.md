Library management system is a project to meet the requirements for keeping the details/data of a library organized. The application will ask the user ‘Student’ to create account or/and log-in to select from different options of the main menu such as to view available books, borrowed books, also may lend and return books. Moreover, the librarian user can add and modify book details( book i.d, title, author name, edition and publication details) and also delete students’ accounts. The users will exit by logging out.
